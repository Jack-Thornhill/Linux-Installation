//       <div>
//         <body>
//           In this guide I'm going to layout a walkthrough for using either a
//           Linux or Windows OS and the steps that you'll take to get your machine
//           up and running with vscode, postgresql, slack, chrome, zoom, npm/node
//           and more. If you're coming into FSA with a PC your first inclination
//           may be to use Windows. However, I would HIGHLY recommend opting to use
//           a Linux operating system instead. The setup may look like it will take
//           longer at the beginning, but a lot of what you'll need for coding will
//           already be included on the Linux installation, and really, the
//           installation, along with all the downloaded applications you'll need
//           will be on Linux. If you still want to use Windows, recognize that
//           you'll need to use a tool called WSL, or Windows Subsystem for Linux,
//           that is essentially running a version of Linux on your Windows
//           machine, that will allow you access to UNIX commands that will be
//           similar to what your classmates are using on their macbooks, so for
//           the most part you'll be able to follow along.
